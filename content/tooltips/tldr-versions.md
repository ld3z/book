# TLDR Versions

There are two main versions of TLDR:

- Web Version: [Visit tldr.sh](https://tldr.inbrowser.app)
- Terminal Version: Install with `sudo apt-get install tldr` and `tldr -u # Update the cache after installation`

Both provide simplified, community-maintained help pages for command-line tools.
